    Doraemon is a blue cat automaton corresponding (tints of pink-orange in earlier comic chapters and media) from the 22nd century, who weighs 129.zg (285.05lbs) and measures at 129.3cm (4'3") tall.</p>

<p>Being a machine, he does not have some average needs of a regular person, such as excretion, since whatever he consumes is automatically converted to energy within his nuclear furnace, although he does need the energy to keep him on the move. His mouth can expand to an incresible size, allowing him to devour larger chunks of food easily. While he has sensors which work similar to their organic, living counterparts on most creatures, his hide and fuselage are incredibly tough, not deforming even while under attack most of the time, although the sensors often end up paralyzing him (such as against biological agents and temperature). While his outer skin can be stained, it is not difficult to clean.</p>

<p>His favorite food is Dorayaki. It was never specified as to how he developed this interest, although some iterations have attributed it to Noramyako, while others claim that he simply finds it tasty after eating one while he is in the past. His addiction to it was often exploited by various people such as Nobita and Sueno. If denied Dorayaki, he would be enraged and go to great lengths just to get one back. He also likes to eat watermelon, pudding, tea, juice and various cakes.</p>

<p>Being also a cat automaton, he is easily infatuated by other cats, living or mechanical. He often acts as a peacekeeper to stop their arguments and gifts many items to them, ignoring his usual hobbies in the process. He would stop pursuing them if he is aware that they are better without him. However, he often gets extremely jealous if his love interests are occupied by others.</p>

<p>Doraemon often gets annoyed easily over anyone when criticize him for his performance or denies his efforts, as he often tries his best to help. His musophobia and iatrophobia often causes him to overreact, even threatening to detonate a nuclear weapon on the spot to kill a rat or refusing to attend to government-mandated robot check-ups. In a panic, Doraemon proves to be troublesome as he often messes up his current task carelessly and can produce hordes of irrelevant items from his 4D pocket, much to the annoyance of others. Another running gag is that Doraemon can be instantly enraged if he is referred to as a Raccoon.</p>

<p>Having no ears, Doraemon is quite shy around mechanical cats that have any, unless he is already acquainted with them.

<p>The manga spawned a media franchise. Three anime TV series have been adapted in 1973, 1979, and 2005. Additionally, Shin-Ei Animation has produced over forty animated films, including two 3D computer animated films, all of which are distributed by Toho. Various types of merchandise and media have been developed, including soundtrack albums, video games, and musicals. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America, via Amazon Kindle, by a collaboration of Fujiko F. Fujio Pro with Voyager Japan and AltJapan Co., Ltd. The anime series was licensed by Disney for an English-language release in North America in 2014, and LUK International in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
